# EE442-Project
Project for the course EE442 - Wireless receivers: algorithms and architectures

## TODO 

## Question
- Is it ok to match filtered the whole sequence to detect preample but then use the signal without match filter
- non-zero phase shift in ideal case, is it normal ? Where can the effect come from ? FFT ? Lowpass ?

## TODO 
- Implement for more than one frame
- test with noise
