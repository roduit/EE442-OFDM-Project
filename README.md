## Abstract 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), widely employed in wireless receivers, is a prominent method for multi-carrier transmission. Specifically, OFDM stands out as a specialized approach within the broader category of multi-carrier transmission methods. The purpose of this project is to implement a OFDM model and study the effect in an acoustic transmission.

The folder *laboratories* contains all the laboratories of the course "EE-442: Wireless Receivers: Algorithms and Architectures". Some of the blocks used in the project come from these labs and are properly cited. *Project* folder contains the code and documentation of the proposed project about OFDM. In the *code* subfolders ofdm_main.m computes the solutions and ofdm_multipath.m can be used to generate simulation of a multipath environment.

## Contributors
This project has been done by Vincent Roduit and Filippo Quadri as a mandatory part of the course "EE-442: Wireless Receivers: Algorithms and Architectures" given at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne during the Fall semester of 2023.

## Theory and results
To gain insight into the project and develop an understanding of the results, you can find the report at *project/resources/documents/report.pdf*. Additionally, the PowerPoint presentation may prove helpful for the reader.
