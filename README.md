## Abstract 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), widely employed in wireless receivers, is a prominent method for multi-carrier transmission. Specifically, OFDM stands out as a specialized approach within the broader category of multi-carrier transmission methods. The purpose of this project is to implement a OFDM model and study the effect in an acoustic transmission.
